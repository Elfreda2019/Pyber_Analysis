# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview

Performing exploratory analysis on csv files for Pyber, a python based ride sharing app company. We are using matplotlibs, jupyter notebooks and writing python  script to create charts to showcase the relationship between the type of cities and number of drivers and riders. 

This analysis and visualization is going to help Pyber improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability.

## Results

From the analysis:

* Total rides in the urban city types were 1000 rides more than in the suburban cities and 1500 rides more than in the rural areas. 

* Same senario applied to the total number of drivers, number of drivers in the urban cities were a little over 1900 more than in the suburban cities and a little over 2300 more than in the rural cities.

* Since the urban cities has more drivers and number of rides, the total fares were also about $25,000 more than that of the suburban cities and $35,000 more than the rural cities.

* However it is interesting to see that the average fare per rides were higher in rural areas than in both the urban and suburban areas with about $10 and $4 respectively.

* Similarly the average fare per driver in the rural cities were almost $39 more than that of the urban areas and $16 more than in the suburban cities.


## Summary

We recommend the following:

 * Rides should be made more accessible in the rural cities by possibly increasing the number of rides available in the rural areas.

 * More drivers should be made available in the rural areas.

 * And finally the fares should be made affordable in the rural cities by reducing the fare prices in the rural cities.
